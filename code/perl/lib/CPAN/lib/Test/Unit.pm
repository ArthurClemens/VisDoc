=head1 NAME

Test::Unit - the PerlUnit testing framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package provides only the project version number, copyright
texts, and a framework overview in POD format.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This framework is intended to support unit testing in an
object-oriented development paradigm (with support for
inheritance of tests etc.) and is derived from the JUnit
testing framework for Java by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.  To
start learning how to use this framework, see
L<Test::Unit::TestCase> and L<Test::Unit::TestSuite>.  (There
will also eventually be a tutorial in
L<Test::Unit::Tutorial>.

However C<Test::Unit::Procedural> is the procedural style
interface to a sophisticated unit testing framework for Perl
that .  Test::Unit is intended to provide a simpler
interface to the framework that is more suitable for use in a
scripting style environment.  Therefore, Test::Unit does not
provide much support for an object-oriented approach to unit
testing.

=head1 FEEDBACK

The Perl Unit development team are humans. In part we develop stuff
because it scratches our collective itch but we'd also really like to
know if it scratches yours.

Please subscribe to the perlunit-users mailing list at
L<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/perlunit-users> and let
us know what you love and hate about PerlUnit and what else you want
to do with it.

# NOTE: this version number has to be kept in sync with the
# number in the distribution file name (the distribution file
# is the tarball for CPAN release) because the CPAN module
# decides to fetch the tarball by looking at the version of
# this module if you say "install Test::Unit" in the CPAN
# shell.  "make tardist" should do this automatically.
