Test::Unit::Tutorial - Tutorial on unit testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perldoc Test::Unit::Tutorial

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Here should be extensive documentation on what unit testing is, why it
is useful, and how to do it with the Test::Unit collection of modules.

Sorry for not implementing this yet.

Please have a look at the examples in the examples directory and read
the F<README> file that came with this distribution.

A short tutorial on how to use the unit testing framework is included
in L<Test::Unit::TestCase>.

Further examples can be found by looking at the self test collection,
starting in t::tlib::AllTests.
