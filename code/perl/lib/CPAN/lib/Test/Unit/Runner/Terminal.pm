=head1 NAME

Test::Unit::Runner::Terminal - unit testing framework helper class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Unit::Runner::Terminal;

    my $testrunner = Test::Unit::Runner::Terminal->new();
    $testrunner->start($my_test_class);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a test runner for the command line style use
of the testing framework.

It is similar to its parent class, Test::Unit::TestRunner, but it uses
terminal escape sequences to continually update a more informative
status report as the runner progresses through the tests than just a
string of dots, E's and F's.  The status report indicates the number
of tests run, the number of failures and errors encountered, which
test is currently being run, and where it lives in the suite
hierarchy.

The class needs one argument, which is the name of the class
encapsulating the tests to be run.
